## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an Industrial Engineer with more than 20 years of experience in Innovation and Digital Transformation.
After many years dedicated to the management of companies and teams, I want to return to everything related to the exciting world of Software Engineering.
So, indeed, I am a student again and it is time to relearn again.
I will be happy to contribute to the community as soon as my knowledge allows it.
By the way, I am Chema for friends.
